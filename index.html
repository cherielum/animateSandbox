            <h1>Elite Yelper</h1>
            <p>I love to eat food and review things that I eat on a daily basis. I love all kinds of cuisines. My favorite dish is always a homemade one. One thing I love eating outside the household is probably anything chicken (i.e. chicken over rice, chicken feet dim sum, chicken tikki masala. If you are also a foodie or love yelp, feel free to follow/add by searching for my full name. </p>

            <p id = "anim-body"> I have been learning how to code on my own since 2016 through programs like Khan Academy, FreeCodeCamp, Udacity and recently enrolled in a bootcamp called Digital Crafts. I am familiar with many languages in a short period of time from front-end to back-end. I am a full stack developer. I know how to use HTML/CSS, JS, Node.js, jQuery, React and Redux. If you have any questions or help with a project regarding these languages, reach out to me at the Contact link!  </p>
